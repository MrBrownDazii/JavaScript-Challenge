# UFO Sighting
# The aim targeted at this project was to create an HTML webpage that contains a table owerfully dependent on a dataset of UFO sightings. This site page will enable users to scan through the table for explicit snippets of data.  To achieve this project request, I was tasked to use the UFO dataset provided in a form of a JavaScript object and write code that would append a table to the webpage and then add new rows of data for each UFO sighting.  In addition, I used JavaScript to create multiple search categories so the user can set set various channels and quest for specific UFO sightings using the criteria based on the table columns.  

# Finally, CSS and Bootstrap were used to create the styling of webpage
